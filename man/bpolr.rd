  Bayesian Ordinal Models
}

\description{
  This function is to set up and fit Bayesian hierarchical ordered logistic or probit regressions for ordinal response (e.g., disease severity)
  with Student-t prior on the coefficients. The default model is Bayesian proportional odds logistic regression, after which the function is named. 
  The Bayesian hierarchical ordered logistic or probit models include classical ordered logistic or probit regression as special case.

\usage{
bpolr(formula, data, weights, start, subset, na.action, 
      method = c("logistic", "probit", "loglog", "cloglog", "cauchit"), 
      contrasts = NULL, Hess = TRUE, prior = Student(0, 0.5, 1), 
      verbose = FALSE) 
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{formula, data, weights, subset, na.action, method, contrasts, Hess}{
  These arguments are the same as in \code{\link[MASS]{polr}}.
}
  \item{start}{
  Initial values for the coefficients (not for zeta).
}
  \item{prior}{
  Prior for the coefficents. only Student-t, \code{Student(mean, scale, df, autoscale)}, can be used. \code{mean}, \code{scale} and \code{df} can be a vector. For example, scale = c(a1,a2,...,ak); if k < the total number of predictors, it is internally expanded to c(a1,a2,...,ak, rep(ak,J-k)). If \code{autoscale=TRUE}, \code{scale} will be modified internally based on the values of the predictors.
}
  
}

\details{
  This function is an alteration of \code{\link[MASS]{polr}} for fitting classical ordered logistic or probit regressions. It uses the quasi-Newton algorithm (BFGS) as implemented in \code{\link{optim}} to fit the model by maximizing the posterior distribution. Bayesian ordinal models allow us to jointly analyze many correlated predictors. The function includes all the \code{\link[MASS]{polr}} arguments and also some new arguments for the hierarchical modeling. 
}
\value{
  This function returns an object of class "polr", including all outputs from the function \code{\link[MASS]{polr}}.
