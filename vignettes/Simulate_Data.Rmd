# Overview
BhGLM includes multiple functions to facilitate the molecular data simulation, where different correlation structures can be specified.

There are three simulation functions
```{r, eval=F}
sim.x(n, m, group, corr, v, p, genotype) # Simulate predictors
sim.eta(x, mu, coefs, herit, sigma, p.neg) # Simulate the linear predictors
sim.y(x, mu, coefs, herit, p.neg, sigma, quantiles, theta, df) # Simulate outcomes
```

The simulation functions were firstly designed to simulate rare variants for genetic study, following @fenner2012a. Later on, these functions were improved to accommodate different structures underlying the predictors, such as (non-overlapping, overlapping) grouped structure [@zhang], network structure.



# Basic usage

## Simulate Predictors with different underlying structure

By design, the predictors $X$ are simulated from a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0s, and variance $\Sigma^2$. The underlying structure of the predictors are numerically reflected in the variance matrix $\Sigma^2$. If there is no group structure among predictors, the argument `group` is set as `NULL`. the parameters `v` and `corr` are used to specify the the variance matrix $\Sigma^2$, where `v` is the diagonal of the variance matrix, and `corr` are the magnitude of covariance. corr can be a scalor or a vector of length 2. The first element of `corr` is the magnitude of within group covariance, and the second element of `corr` is the between group covariance, i.e. the covariance for two predictors that are not belong to the same group.
```{r}
n = 500
m = 20
sim.x(n, m, group = NULL)
```

### Non-grouped covariates


### Grouped covariates
```{r}
grp <-list(paste0("X", 1:4),
           paste0("X",5:20))
sim.x(n, m, group = grp)
```

### Overlapping Groupped Predictors
```{r}
grp <-list(paste0("X", 1:6),
           paste0("X",5:20))
sim.x(n, m, group = grp)
```

### Network Groupped Predictors
```{r}

sim.x(n, m, group=A)

```
## Simulate Genotyping Data
The argument `genotype` and `p` are only relavent when we simulate the predictors as genotyping data. For more
